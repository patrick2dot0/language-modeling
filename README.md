# language-modeling

The goal of language modelling is to maximize the probability of target sentences
by maximizing the probability of the next word at each time steps.
In this repo, we implement TCN、RNN、STCN、CRN、SCRN as our language models.
We use Penn Tree Bank (PTB) as our corpus.

- CPU: Intel Core i7-4930K @3.40 GHz
